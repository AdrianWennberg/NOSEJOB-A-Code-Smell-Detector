The basic website is up and running on the netsoc servers: http://thecodingrangers.netsoc.com/

So, Alessandro has changed the interfaces for the project analysis. There was a lot of discussion and 
some conflict on which way to go about it. Alessandro who had been working on it wanted to remove the 
"Report" classes as they were mainly data storage and seemed redundant. Will argued that clean data storage
classes would be very simple to use from a front end perspective. We discussed it and eventually agreed to
go back to something closer to the interfaces that we originally designed.

The only change to the original interfaces that we agreed on is that the ProjectReport interface will also
have a method to get a list of Smells directly:
List<SmellReport> getSmellReports();


We still have a bit to do before the MVP is done even though we're coming up to the deadline for sprint 2.
What need to be done to finish MVP:
	Test primitive obsession.
	Reactivate analyze button and displaying uploaded files.
	Parsing is done.
	Dode data is done.
	Need to set up dashboard to display smell
	
Will takes care of putting things together by this time next week. 


Heres what we agreed to cover for the next sprint. 
Six smells to do next
	- Violation of Data Privacy
	- Bloated Code
	- Feature Envy
	- Inappropriate Intimacy
	- God Complex
	- Data-Only Classes
	
Other features sprint 2
	- Upload projects (zip files)
	- Prettify front end
	- Add exceptions to parser
	- Extend project data interface to store data about what has been correctly parsed.
