Present: Adrian, Will, Alessandro, Peter

The main question we started considering was what sort of 
user interface we use. The question came down to "do we mane a Web app or a desktop GUI?"

We settled quickly on trying to go ahead with a web app, and Will suggested the Play Framework.
Will agreed to test the framework over the weekend and next week, we'll have a plan of how to structure our porject.

The idea of the framework will be that the user uploads their files and a server side java application does an 
analysis and sens back the results. We all agreed that we want some sort of nice GUI for displaying our results and we
will look into default statistics presentation tools to use.

Since we are making both a Web interface and the back end logic for the code smell detector, we agreed to have a modular
interface bsed structure where the logic part works as an API that the Web app can simply hook into. We also considered
building a simple console fornt end for the API so that you can get the same results by using the application through
the terminal.

We had a few other ideas that we will consider as we get the spesifications and start figuring out how the code analysis
is done.
1. We could try suggesting fixes for the code smells and automatically implement the fixes for the user.
2. If we manage to define the smells using JSON or XML, we could potentially let users define their own smells.
3. Depending on how the logic/API works, we can see if it is possible to hook it into an IDE or intellisense.
