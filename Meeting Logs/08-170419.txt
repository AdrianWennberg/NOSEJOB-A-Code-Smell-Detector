Eighth Official Meeting Log
17. Apr 2019 11:00

We started discussing the state of the project and came to a few conclusions:
 - don't bother showing smell instances on the dashboard for now
 - Methods should generate their own return type 'variable' since 
	it is not really a variable from the parser's POV. varialbe 'name'
	can be the same as the method name.
 - We want to handle it from the Dashboard if no .java 
	files are found within the project being analyzed
 - We do not need to add more smells at this point. We should focus
	on getting things working well instead.
 - We want to add a short description for each smell found.

Here are some things we have gotten working since we last talked.
 - Second sprint smells
 - Error page
 - Dashboard



The server is close to working. 
It is currently down with a 502, but that should be a simple fix.

Here's what we need to get it up and running:
 - We need the code storage working properly - so we put it in the resources folder.
 - Update the parser to have all the sprint 2 smells working.
 - Add Zip upload, this should be the main way to take in files
 - Launch it on the server.

What we need to do the last week if we get it up and running:
 - Testing to make sure the server keeps running, and deals with edge cases
 - Make sure we have a localhost version of the project available
 - Make the dashboard as good as we can
 - Make sure it can run on our own project and fix our code to get things working.
 - Tweak smells to give correct looking results

Final Report
 - Oh God, we have a week and a half left!
 - Everyone writes what they can. Just focus on getting it done at this point.
