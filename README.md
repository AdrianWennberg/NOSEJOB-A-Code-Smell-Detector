# NOSEJOB-A-Code-Smell-Detector
The 4 student team called The Coding Rangers' version of the software engineering assignment titled NOSEJOB: A Code Smell Detector

This detector will be written mainly using Java. The spec has so far been fairly loose, and we'll get to be creative in how we design out detector.

The repository will most likely be structured to store both the code files and the reports that we have to include as a part of the projects. Either that, or we will link to the report repository from here.
